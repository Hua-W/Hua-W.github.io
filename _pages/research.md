 <b>Abstract:</b> Recent economic recessions feature dramatic rises in uncertainty. Empirical studies have found large-scale portfolio rebalancing towards nominally safe assets in times of high uncertainty. This paper builds a New Keynesian model with idiosyncratic risk and incomplete markets to study the transmission of uncertainty shocks through investors' portfolio decisions and how monetary-fiscal policy can stabilize fluctuations in demand for safe assets. In response to a sudden increase in uncertainty, investors reallocate their resources from productive assets to safe assets for precautionary motives. When prices are sticky, the heightened demand for safe assets leads to overshooting in capital price, which gives rise to aggregate demand recessions. Conventional monetary policy that operates through interest rate changes alone has limited power in influencing household portfolios. Instead, fiscal policy plays a crucial role in price stabilization and optimal policy.

<b>Abstract:</b> Observed choices between risky lotteries are difficult to reconcile with expected utility maximization, both because subjects appear to be too risk averse with regard to small gambles for this to be explained by diminishing marginal utility of wealth, as stressed by Rabin (2000), and because subjects’ responses involve a random element. We propose a unified explanation for both anomalies, similar to the explanation given for related phenomena in the case of perceptual judgments: they result from judgments based on imprecise (and noisy) mental representations of the decision situation. In this model, risk aversion results from a sort of perceptual bias—but one that represents an optimal decision rule, given the limitations of the mental representation of the situation. We propose a quantitative model of the noisy mental representation of simple lotteries, based on other evidence regarding numerical cognition, and test its ability to explain the choice frequencies that we observe in a laboratory experiment.

<b>Abstract:</b> Recent experiments suggest that search direction causally affects the discounted valuation of delayed payoffs. Comparisons between options can increase individuals’ patience toward future payoff options, while searching within options instead promotes impatient choices. We further test the robustness and specificity of this relationship using a novel choice task. Here individuals choose between pairs of delayed payoffs instead of single delayed outcomes. We observe a relationship between search styles and temporal discounting that are the opposite of those previously reported. Integrators—those who tend to compare attributes within alternatives—discount and choose more slowly than comparators—those who are more likely to compare between alternatives. This finding supports and augments the view that individuals’ search strategy is predictive of subsequent discount rates. In particular, the direction of this relationship is further modifiable based on the spatial layout and varying information within an individual’s decision-making environment.
